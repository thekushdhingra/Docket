# 📦 Docket - A TUI for Managing Docker Containers & Images

Docket is a terminal-based user interface (TUI) for managing Docker containers and images using a simple, keyboard-driven approach. It leverages `tview` and `tcell` to provide an interactive and intuitive experience for Docker users.

## ✨ Features

- View running containers and available images in a structured table format
- Start, stop, delete, and rename containers easily
- Create new containers from images
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
- Responsive and color-coded UI

## 🛠 Installation

### If you are not on Windows or arch linux:

Ensure you have Go and Docker installed. Then, clone the repo and build it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thekushdhingra/docket.git
cd docket
go build -o docket
```

Run the application:

```sh
./docket
```

### If you are on arch linux

```sh
yay -S docket
```

> If you are on windows, download the installer from the releases section and install it.
